@2015-03-10:

The works on kernel 3.14 were stopped for now and I decided
to continue only on on the 3.16, 3.18, 3.19 and later versions.
The 3.16 Direct Rendering Management an the drivers for the Intel/NVidia/AMD-Radeon
Graphic cards were significantly faster.
Ubuntu does maintain the 3.16 kernel and also OpenSuSE-13.2,
with the Quirky7/April releases, I did not have any difficulties to run the 3.16.7 kernel version.
DVB-TV for USB and maybe more drivers seem to be broken since 3.16.7!
